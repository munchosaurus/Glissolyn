  questStartDialogue:
  - '{playerName}, I believe you might be our only chance.

    The crystal must
    be stopped. Could you go southwest of the city'
  - and destroy the crystal the same way you did back home in Wakefield? I understand
    that it is much I am asking of you. I truly wish there was another way.
  - Stride carefully though, the paths are filled with more enemies than you might
    be able to handle
  questActiveDialogue:
  - Hurry {playerName} !
  questCompletionDialogue:
  - You did it, you truly did it! Here, take some experience points. Also, I happen
    to be a mage and I have noticed that the zombies and
  - other creatures are weak against fire. Please, use the attack Fireball as much
    as you will.
  - Now, we will send some of our forces back up to Eldham, where the true threat
    is.. Why don't you go ahead and do the same?
  questCompletedDialogue:
  - I am so happy you were here.
  objectToInteractWith: Medium Crystal
