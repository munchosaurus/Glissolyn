  questStartDialogue:
  - I dont have time for you, boy!..
  - Wait.. you look familiar... Whats your name, boy?
  - '{playerName}? So its true.'
  - People have been talking about a young lad running around with a sceptre smashing
    up crystals.
  - I just assumed people were living a lie... you see.
  - A few years before you were born Glissolyn was attacked by a group of Witches.
  - These witches wanted to corrupt the land in order to further their evil deeds.
  - Luckily a hero arose to fight them off with a sceptre imbued with magical powers.
  - That hero was...
  - ...Your father.
  - I served with him in the milita back then.
  - I was but a lowly private and he was my senior officer. A great man. I owe him
    my life.
  - All of Glissolyn does...
  - And I'm getting the feeling that soon they will be indebted to you as well.
  - Haha, well said. A hero does not seek out danger for praise or reward.
  - Your father had the same attitude, he would be proud of you.
  - Oh well enough chatting! There is a crystal to the east of here and we had no
    luck getting to it.
  - Go take care of it will ya?
  questActiveDialogue:
  - I would love to tell you more about your father, but it will have to wait until
    the crisis is over.
  questCompletionDialogue:
  - Great job, i knew i could count on you!
  - The next step will be to travel north across the wall into the witches swamp.
  - I'm guessing the wall must have been broken through for there to be witches on
    this side.
  - So be prepared, there are surely dangers ahead.
  questCompletedDialogue:
  - Hurry, we need to end this.
  objectToInteractWith: Large Crystal
